                <p>
                    <strong>a2rp: mini-projects</strong> is a personal initiative designed to build, document, and showcase practical frontend mini-projects using <strong>ReactJS</strong> and modern JavaScript. This collection serves not only as a hands-on learning ground but also as a portfolio of structured, real-world user interface solutions. Each project is built with simplicity, scalability, and reusability in mind.
                </p>

                <h3>üîç Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The primary aim of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core and advanced React concepts by building them into isolated, easy-to-navigate apps. Instead of focusing on one large application, I chose to break ideas into small, focused modules to learn faster and demonstrate one concept or skill at a time.
                </p>
